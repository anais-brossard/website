			<h2> MY PROJECT </h2>
		  <p>
		  	My name is Anais Brossard, and I am a student at Kedge Business school, in the "Programme Grandes Ecoles". I have created this webpage, because I would like to develop an ecocup that could detect the presence of GHB. The drinks would change of color as soon as a drug is put in the glass. I have got this idea because of the increase of the number of abuses. The idea is to propose and market this glass to bars, festivals and nightclubs. To start with this project, I think it is a good idea to have this support to put my ideas, potential partners and my goals.

 			<h2> GOALS </h2>
		  <p>
		    The term date rape drug refers to certain products that can be added to a drink without changing the taste, appearance or color. This is how some dishonest people aim to make a person absorb the product and then abuse him. <br><br>

			Each year, it is estimated that millions of men and women will unwittingly consume a "date rape drug" unknowingly slipped into their drink. These drugs, often slipped into alcoholic beverages, can cause amnesia, and blackouts, and they're incredibly difficult to detect.<br><br>
 
		  	This is why I would like to develop ecocups that would immediatly change color to warn you when someone slips a date rape drug into your drink. This glass will be available in bars, festivals and nightclubs. Moreover, I would like to organize an awarness campaign to sensitize the population and try to do partnership with associations like RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network).
